# PurdueGenderWageGap2018
In this project, I am asking multiple questions. First, is there a wage gap between male and female staff members at Purdue University? Second, if there is, is that difference statistically significant? 

I plan to use R to analyze the data using descriptive statistics and I also plan to write and publish an article about my findings.
