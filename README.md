# PurdueGenderWageGap2018
In this project, I wanted to figure out if there was a pay gap between males and females at Purdue University. I ended up finding that there was a statistically significant gap between the pay of males and females. 

I leveraged RStudio to analyze and filter the data and I published an article about my findings on Medium.com
