# PurdueGenderPayGap2018
In this project, I wanted to figure out if there was a pay gap between males and females at Purdue University. I ended up finding that there was a statistically significant gap between the pay of males and females. 

I leveraged RStudio to analyze and filter the data and I published an article about my findings on Medium which you can find with this link here: https://medium.com/@slingam00/examining-the-gender-pay-gap-at-purdue-university-f7db81910fff?sk=369768fcf6f85732f24a964105704aff
